### Why we should use C++ instead of Java
1. I like C++
2. There are more libraries
3. cout is a *lot* shorter than System.out.println()
4. I am used to it
5. C++ can do literally everything
6. I like it when not everything has to be a class
7. Java is RAM eating juice
### If I have to use Java, I guess I'll just put up with it but C++ will always be my favorite
### Now here is a list of animals that are cute but underrated
- Slugs and snails (slime bunnies!)
- Lizards 
- Vultures, especially baby vultures, because they're super fuzzy
- Crows (very intelligent)
- Daphnia
- Jumping spiders (not when they randomly appear in my room though)
- FUZZY MOTH 
- Sharks. Shark attacks are super uncommon and more people die of beestings than shark attacks
