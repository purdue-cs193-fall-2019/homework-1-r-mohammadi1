### Raha's First CS193 Homework
## Favorite things about CS193 
- It is not a difficult course
- Unlike Calculus, it does not start at seven in the morning
- I found out about asciiquarium by going to class
- Honestly if any lecture contains the word 'yeet' even just once then it's a good class
### The rest of this website is irrelevant:
## Why we should use C++ instead of Java
1. I like C++
2. There are more libraries
3. cout is a *lot* shorter than System.out.println()
4. I am used to it
5. C++ can do literally everything
6. I like it when not everything has to be a class
7. Java is RAM eating juice
## If I have to use Java, I guess I'll just put up with it but C++ will always be my favorite
## Now here is a list of animals that are cute but underrated
- Slugs and snails (slime bunnies!)
- Lizards 
- Vultures, especially baby vultures, because they're super fuzzy
- Crows (very intelligent)
- Daphnia
- Jumping spiders (not when they randomly appear in my room though)
- FUZZY MOTH 
- Sharks. Shark attacks are super uncommon and more people die of beestings than shark attacks
## Q: Why does stackoverflow keep marking my questions as duplicate?
